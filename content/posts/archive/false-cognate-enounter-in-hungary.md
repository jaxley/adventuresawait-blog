In the first day or two of being in Hungary, I noticed some eladó signs on buildings while passing by on the tram and my first thought was that perhaps the Hungarian word for "ice cream" was similar to the Spanish "helado".  Fortunately, this was a [false cognate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_cognate).  Otherwise, Hungary would be quite sad as it seemed that all of the ice cream places were shuttered. (Eladó means "for sale")
