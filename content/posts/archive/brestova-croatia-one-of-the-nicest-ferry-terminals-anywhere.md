An adjacent beach with warm, crystal-clear water makes having to wait for the ferry not so bad.  We were roasting, so it felt great to cool off after the drive. And tasty pizza at the restaurant was an added bonus!

Had an hour-long, white-knuckle drive to our campsite on the island of Cres after the short ferry ride.  A giant wasp flying into the window while I was driving didn't help either.

Glad to finally be in one place for the near future. Lots of Adriatic coast to explore in the coming days.
