Our second stop in Cambodia was Battambang.  Supposedly this is the second largest city in Cambodia, but it was significantly smaller than Phnom Penh.  We were a bit concerned as we arrived and our driver went through the town, turned down a dirt road passing flooded fields and some abandoned structures.  When we finally stopped it was due to the road being torn up and we weren't clear if this was our destination or if we had to walk from that point.  Fortunately several people came to carry our luggage over the muddy road and we entered our hotel oasis!

We did very little here for the first two days besides swimming.  The kids were literally in the water for 5-6 hours a day.  They have turned into confident, eager little fish doing belly flops, diving for rocks and swimming back and forth.

One evening we took a tuk tuk into town to see a circus show.  Phare Ponlue Selpak is an organization that provides support to underprivileged children and families through education in the arts.  The show was a combination of music, acrobats, performance art and dance.  We've read that some of its members have moved on to Cirque du Soleil.  We were completely captivated by the unique and creative scenes before us.  It is as must see for sure!
