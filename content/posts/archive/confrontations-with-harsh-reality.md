A forewarning: although traveling brings a lot of joy and amazing new experiences, it can also bring you face-to-face with some horrific aspects of mankind.  I felt compelled to write about this experience as it was deeply troubling to me that had to be shared.

As a family, we recently toured the Jewish quarter here in Budapest, Hungary.  We had many opportunities in Eastern Europe to face the brutality of war, the holocaust and humanity, but we had decided to avoid the truly horrific as our kids just seem far too young to grapple with such weighty subjects right now.  We have touched on these topics in more general terms as they have asked questions about certain things we have seen along the way or heard something in passing.  (TODO: examples?)

We toured the Jewish quarter when we were in Wroclaw, Poland as well on a free walking tour.  There I found out about interesting historical reasons why the Jewish quarter there is located where it is (Jews were not allowed to live within the city walls that used to be there, so they settled just outside the Wroclaw / Breslau city walls)  But the brutal history got to me most here in Budapest.

The population of Hungary was about 5% Jewish, with Jews comprising as much as 22% of the population of Budapest in 1910 ([wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary))  Jewish resentment grew in Hungary during the period of WW II and resulted at first in restrictive laws targeting the Jews, mirroring Nuremberg laws in Germany.  Persecution started from within.  When Germany took over Hungary, things got far worse ([link](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005458))  Over 500,000 countrywide were forced into ghettos where thousands of them died.  We walked right past the tiny park where roughly 2500 were buried in mass graves that died of exposure and related afflictions during the ghetto confinement.  That is horrific enough - to have your own fellow countrymen round you up and stand by while you and your family suffer and die.  But it gets worse.  The Jews in the ghettos were rounded up and put onto trains for deportation to Auschwitz and other camps.  But things still got worse for them. The Germans replaced officials in charge (Arrow Cross...ADD MORE) that had halted the deportations, leaving them to murder and terrorize the remaining Jews, sometimes putting them into forced labor.

While we were touring the Jewish quarter, I read a short passage in Rick Steve's Budapest book that brought me to tears.  I had to stop reading out loud as there was no way I could get through it myself, let alone expose my kids to this kind of brutality and indifference to human life and decency.  It was about the Shoes on the Danube (which has its own monument).  Brutal fascists during the Arrow Cross regime, who were in many cases rushing to get rid of the Jews nearing the end of the war, would routinely tie people together on the banks of the Danube and shoot some of them.  They would then fall into the frigid river, pulling others (still alive) with them.  That is horrific enough, but on top of that, the rationale given was to "save bullets" apparently.  Even more appalling, th Jews were ordered to remove their shoes first so their shoes would be left behind.  http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/31/shoes.asp

At the reading of that

I have been thinking about this off and on for the past week or more - trying to come to grips with my reaction and how best to address these harsh realities with my kids someday.  In parallel, the US Congress is currently pushing to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  I have been horrified by the .  And yet I had a realization that this kind of indifferene for human suffering, dignity and life is ino way different tha
