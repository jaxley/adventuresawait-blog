As with most places, our first view of a new country is the chaotic hustle and bustle of the train station and getting a quick overview of public transit so we can get to our new house.  Budapest, Hungary was no different, except that when we emerged from the underground we were treated to a spectacular view of the Parliament building.

Margaret Island was a short distance from our place and quickly became a frequent stop for us.  It also happened to be one of the few tram stops we could read and understand.  So many consonants!  Margaret Island has a lot to offer, a huge green space, a small zoo (we saw baby storks), several playgrounds, hourly fountain shows and most importantly a waterpark!  We hit the waterpark a few times to beat the heat.  No pictures though, we were too busy having fun.  

We lucked out and caught the first light and music fountain show of the season.  The kids even had front row seats.  On our way home we continued to be amazed by this beautiful city.  The bridge, Parliament and several other buidling were lit up fantastically.

We spent the afternoon exploring the Castle district.  Here we found a cathedral covered with a colorfully intricate tile roof.  We came back on another evening to listen to an organ concert here.  The music and church interior were amazing, but the kids got a little bored.  Other highlights of Castle Hill were the fisherman's castle and castle grounds where we found Disney like features.  Rapunzel's tower, Sleeping Beauty's castlethat was reminiscent of a Disneyland castle.  We saw  mini changing of the guards, we took the funicular up the hill
