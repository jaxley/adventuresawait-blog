We're in Spain!  Sevilla to be exact. 

We've been gone for a little over a month now.  Here is a collection of random thoughts, just to get everyone caught up, since we have not been blogging regularly...I mean at all.

\- Homeschooling is hard.  I'm pretty sure they think we are stupid and don't need to listen to us.  We are however finally making some progress.  After a good 2 weeks of complaining, Spencer has finally written in his journal.  He said "he blew himself away", yippee!!!

\- We have been to more playgrounds than the average tourist.  Maybe we should make a World Playground Map.  Obviously some are better than others.  In London, there were lots, the Princess Diana park was awesome, even with the line to get in.  Morocco, there were not so many.  A few on the beach, where you could pay by the half hour.  So far the Spanish ones are the best.  There are several near our apartment, and best of all, they are conveniently located next to outdoor cafes.  Where we can drink tinto de veranos as we lovingly watch the kids play and attempt to talk with local kids.

\- Bathrooms are also not created equally.  For instance in Morocco, you will always need money to give to the attendant.  She is the keeper of the door, lights, toilet paper and paper towels.  Don't even think about asking for soap.  I took to carrying a roll of toilet paper in my purse.  My favorite trip to the WC was with Adele.  We were led away from the restaurant, down the street, around the corner, into another restaurant, up a narrow set of stairs to an awkward landing that was too short for me to stand in and then presented with our first hole in the floor toilet.  Adele was beside herself, there was NO way!  I attempted to convince her it would be fine, just like camping, but she wasn't having it.

\- In Morocco, we saw lots of heads, detached ones.  If I remember correctly, we saw countless goat heads (and hooves), a ram, a camel and a shark.  They were proudly on display at most meat counters.  With cages of chickens, bunnies and even a turkey near by and awaiting their turn.  It was startling to say the least.

\- Food is hard.  Why does everyone have to eat ALL the time?  We have spent a significant amount of time locating places to buy food, restaurants to eat in, translating menus, attempting to ask questions about what we are ordering and ordering.  Then of course explaining to the kids that we have no idea what is about to be served, but not to worry "this is part of the adventure"!  The various tagines and couscous are amazing in Morocco.  But sadly we were burned out after a solid of week of eating these.  The kids were SO happy to see spaghetti on a menu.  In Spain we've been shopping at a local market, where Jason gets to practice is Spanish.  I get immediately flustered, but he has improved so much, we almost always get what we ask for!  He asked if the apricots were dulce (sweet), we ended up getting doce (12).  Fortunately they were sweet and the kids liked them.

Traveling with kids is proving a bit harder than we thought.  They want to eat ALL the time, like we never feed them.  They don't seem to like us as homeschooling teachers, they think they know more than us.  We've seen more playgrounds than the average tourist.
