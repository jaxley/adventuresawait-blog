We had heard about the Blue caves and when i looked for tour prices and read the reviews and saw the photos, i knew we had to do a tour. I booked it immediately online for mid-week during our stay on Hvar.

It was a bit stressful to start. Seems no matter how much planning you do, there is still enough uncertainty to make you uneasy, especially when it's an all-day excursion with no hope to return home for any reason.  The bus system on Hvar is not bad, but the timetable only lists departure times and not the arrival times or route or stops inbetween. I thought i had interpreted the schedule such that we would arrive from Vrboska to Hvar by 10:00am for a 10:30am tour. Well, turns out the bus ends in Hvar as the last stop and stops about everywhere else inbetween.  It took 1 1/2 hours to go 20km! The price was right, but stress induced may not have been worth the savings. It all turned out alright though.  fortunately were able to call and email the tour company to wait for us.  The walk around the Riva to the meeting point in Hvar was the longest walk ever though!

Insert highlights of blue caves and beaches....

We had good luck returning to Vrboska though. Bus was much faster and we caught up to the one that was full and we missed and switched to that. Beat $62 estimated cab fare!
